Getting Started

This will help you understand how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

Installation Steps:



1. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
   - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Run the following command:
     ```
     conda create -p <Environment_Name> python==<python version> -y
     ```

2. Activate the Virtual Environment (Optional)
   - Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:
       ```
       conda activate <Environment_Name>/
       ```

3. Install Dependencies
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd [project_directory]
     ```
   - Run the following command to install project dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. Run the Project
   - Start the project by running the appropriate command.
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

5. Access the Project
   - Open a web browser or the appropriate client to access the project.

   

API Key Usage
This project utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3 API for generating responses. To run the chatbot with the API, you'll need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. Follow the steps below to set up your API key:

Obtaining an OpenAI API Key:
- Sign Up on OpenAI Platform:
  - If you don't have an account, sign up on the OpenAI platform.

- Create a New API Key:
  - Once logged in, navigate to the API section or dashboard.
  - Create a new API key by following the on-screen instructions.
    
- Copy Your API Key:
  - After creating the API key, copy it from the OpenAI platform.

    
Adding API Key to the Project:
- Create a .env File:
  - In the project's root directory, create a file named .env.

- Add API Key to .env:
  - Open the ```.env``` file in a text editor.
  - Add the following line, replacing your-api-key with the actual API key:
  - ```sh
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```
  - Save the file.

Using the API Key in the Project:
The project automatically reads the API key from the .env file using the python-dotenv library. Once the key is added to the .env file, the chatbot will use it to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3 API.

Note: Ensure the .env file is kept secure and not shared publicly, as it contains sensitive information.
